### Description:

This repository is a collection of boilerplates for web application development. The main branch contains a Readme.md file that describes the repository structure and each of the three branches in detail.

The first branch, Basic boilerplate, provides a simple template for creating websites that do not require JavaScript or only use a small amount of scripts. It includes tools such as Webpack for bundling and serving the application, Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript to ES5, ESLint with the Airbnb style guide for code linting, Prettier for code formatting, PostCSS with Autoprefixer for CSS processing, SCSS for styling, Husky and lint-staged for code quality assurance, jQuery for DOM manipulation, and Tailwind for utility-first CSS.

The second branch, Advanced boilerplate, is designed for building more complex websites that require additional tools and technologies. In addition to the tools provided in the Basic boilerplate, it also includes React and React DOM for developing user interfaces, Redux and Redux Saga for managing application state, and Jest for testing.

The third branch, TS Advanced boilerplate, is similar to the Advanced boilerplate, but also includes support for TypeScript. This allows you to write type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process.

In summary, Web Development Boilerplate is a versatile resource that can help you get started with web application development quickly and easily. Whether you are building a simple website or a complex web application, there is a template in this repository that can help you get started. And if you have suggestions or contributions to make, we welcome your input!
